it's a simple way to generate midi music with python


You should have Csvmidi.exe in the same folder as the file.

I love music but I never saw myself being a player. I still don't want to be a player but I wanted to know how the music works and how I could create them.

First of all, Music theory is very easy but if you simplify it for yourself. I studied cinema and animation and we always had some classes about music but it all were so confusing.

because I wanted to program it I broke it into parts and I changed notes to numbers. For example, there are 12 notes in music but instead of learning them by name I learned their numbers from 0 to 11 and how they were connected. then I learned the scales. Nobody had ever told me that there were different kind of scales. they just put the notes in front of you and tell you to memorize it. but I learned that there are different kind of scales. and I chose to work 8 note scales (I guess it's called octatonic I'm not sure).

then there are major and minor and their chords.

it would be very very very difficult task if you just put the notes in front of you and try to memorize them but as I said I leaned them by numbers. by looking at the numbers you can easily see the relationship between the notes in each chord and each scale. it took me literally 2 hours to learn all of that. but in school we had a year of music class and I didn't learn anything.

anyways, I just put the numbers one after the other and I made the program.

now I should make sound of of those notes otherwise it would be just a bunch of notes write after each other. the best way for me was to go for midi. There is an AMAZING program that would convert csv to midi and vice versa. it's called midicsv. So instead of writing midi directly I wrote in csv and then convert it to midi.

you can play or convert midi in many ways which i'm sure you can find by just googling it.

now that everything worked I wanted to learn how to create the music so I defined some steps for myself and then applied them to the program.

1.  Choose the key note
2.  Choose the type of scale you want to build on the key note (Major, Minor)
3.  Choose Chord progression
4.  Choose the rhythm in the chord progression(also remember the silence)
5.  repeat the process and add layer by layer to the music

remember that for chords you can't just put three notes right below each other. imagine each layer is like a line. in each layer you should add one note of the chord.
