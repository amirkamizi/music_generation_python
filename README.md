# music_generation_python
it's a simple way to generate midi music with python

You should have Csvmidi.exe in the same folder as the file.

1.  Choose the key note
2.  Choose the type of scale you want to build on the key note (Major, Minor)
3.  Choose Chord progression
4.  Choose the rhythm in the chord progression(also remember the silence)
5.  repeat the process and add layer by layer to the music

remember that for chords you can't just put three notes right below each other. imagine each layer is like a line. in each layer you should add one note of the chord.
